## It's not illegal
In terms of legality, a tool isn't illegal unless used unethically. The tool can be used to track someone's keystrokes when using your pc. It's very much safe to assume that a user will turn this on just to make sure that the one using your pc isn't doing anything **SUS**.

## C++
C++ is a general-purpose progrmming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
The language is a superset of the programming language C, although this language is really not that type safe just like it's older sibling, it still is a good 
programming langauge to use when making exploits, malwares etc.

## More Info
I reffered the code to a keylogger tutorial i found on youtube, although i forgot the youtube channel. ðŸ¤¦
